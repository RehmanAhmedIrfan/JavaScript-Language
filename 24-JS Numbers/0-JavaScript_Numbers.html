    <!-- JavaScript has only one type of number. Numbers can be written with or without decimals. -->
let x = 3.14;    // A number with decimals
let y = 3;       // A number without decimals
<!-- Extra large or extra small numbers can be written with scientific (exponent) notation: -->
let x = 123e5;    // 12300000
let y = 123e-5;   // 0.00123
<!-- Integers (numbers without a period or exponent notation) are accurate up to 15 digits. -->
let x = 999999999999999;   // x will be 999999999999999
let y = 9999999999999999;  // y will be 10000000000000000
<!-- Try these calculations -->
let x = 0.2 + 0.1;
let x = (0.2 * 10 + 0.1 * 10) / 10;
<!-- If you add two numbers, the result will be a number: -->
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z = x + y;
<!-- If you add two strings, the result will be a string concatenation: -->
let x = "10";
let y = "20";
let z = x + y;
<!-- If you add a number and a string, the result will be a string concatenation: -->
let x = 10;
let y = "20";
let z = x + y;
<!-- If you add a string and a number, the result will be a string concatenation: -->
let x = "10";
let y = 20;
let z = x + y;
<!-- A common mistake is to expect this result to be 30: -->
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z = "The result is: " + x + y;  <!-- in start it is a string so it will concatenate -->
<!-- A common mistake is to expect this result to be 102030: -->
let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z = "30";
let result = x + y + z;<!-- output will be 3030  -->
<!-- JavaScript will try to convert strings to numbers in all numeric operations: This will work: -->
let x = "100";
let y = "10";
let z = x / y; <!--output will be 10-->
<!-- This will also work -->
let x = "100";
let y = "10";
let z = x * y;
<!-- And this will work: -->
let x = "100";
let y = "10";
let z = x - y;
<!-- But this will not work: -->
let x = "100";
let y = "10";
let z = x + y;
