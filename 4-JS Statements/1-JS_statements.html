    <h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>
    <p>A <b>JavaScript program</b> is a list of <b>statements</b> to be executed by a computer.</p>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
        let x, y, z;
        x = 5;
        y = 6;
        z = x + y;

        document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = "The value of z is : " + z + ".";  
        // document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = z; 
    </script>

</body>

<!--* JavaScript statements are composed of:
Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.
This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";


JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code.

Semicolons ;
Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.

Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:


let a, b, c;  // Declare 3 variables
a = 5;        // Assign the value 5 to a
b = 6;        // Assign the value 6 to b
c = a + b;    // Assign the sum of a and b to c


When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:

a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;


On the web, you might see examples without semicolons.
Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended.
