<!--* JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.

The following lines are equivalent:

let person = "Hege";
let person="Hege";
A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ):

let x = y + z; -->


<!--? JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks
For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:


document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"Hello Dolly!"; -->
