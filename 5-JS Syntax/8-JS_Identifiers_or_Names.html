<!-- Identifiers are JavaScript names.

Identifiers are used to name variables and keywords, and functions.
The rules for legal names are the same in most programming languages.
A JavaScript name must begin with:

A letter (A-Z or a-z)
A dollar sign ($)
Or an underscore (_)

Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs. 

Note:
Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names.
This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers.

<!-- JavaScript is Case Sensitive
All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive. 
The variables lastName and lastname, are two different variables:

let lastname, lastName;
lastName = "Doe";
lastname = "Peterson"; -->


<!-- JavaScript does not interpret LET or Let as the keyword let. -->
