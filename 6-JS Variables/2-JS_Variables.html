<!-- You can declare many variables in one statement.
Start the statement with let and separate the variables by comma:
let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200; -->


<!-- A declaration can span multiple lines:
let person = "John Doe",
carName = "Volvo",
price = 200; -->


<!-- If you re-declare a JavaScript variable declared with var, it will not lose its value.
The variable carName will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements:
var carName = "Volvo";
var carName; -->


<!-- You cannot re-declare a variable declared with let or const.
This will not work:
let carName = "Volvo";
let carName; -->
